# Aqua Trade

## Trading Platform Service

The service is a trading platform. It will provide APIs for the Website to do following things:
1. Create and manage trader holders, which are composed of user’s name, balance, and currency.
2. Record all balance changes to each of the trader holder. So each time payment record will be created.
3. Perform payments between holders within a transaction, that means either both balance are updated successfully or all failed.
