# Aqua Trade

## Trading Platform Service

The service is a trading platform. It will provide APIs for the Website to do following things:
1. Create and manage trader accounts, which are composed of userâ€™s name, balance, and currency.
2. Record all balance changes to each of the trader account. So each time payment record will be created.
3. Perform payments between accounts within a transaction, that means either both balance are updated successfully or all failed.
